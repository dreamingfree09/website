# Security Features Implementation Guide

## 🔒 Implemented Security Features

### 1. HTTP Security Headers (Helmet.js)
**Purpose:** Protect against common web vulnerabilities

**Features:**
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME-type sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security:** Forces HTTPS in production
- **X-XSS-Protection:** Browser XSS protection

**Configuration:** See `app.js` (Helmet setup and CSP directives).

### 2. Rate Limiting
**Purpose:** Prevent brute force and DDoS attacks

**Limits Implemented:**
- **API Routes:** 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication:** 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Post Creation:** 10 posts per hour per IP

**Benefits:**
- Prevents credential stuffing
- Stops spam posting
- Protects server resources

### 3. Input Validation (express-validator)
**Purpose:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs

**Validation Rules:**
- **Email:** Valid format, normalized, max 255 chars
- **Username:** 3-30 chars, alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen, no reserved names
- **Password:** 8-128 chars, must include uppercase, lowercase, and number
- **Post Title:** 5-200 chars, HTML escaped
- **Post Content:** 10-10,000 chars
- **URLs:** Valid format, domain-specific checks for social links

**Location:** `utils/validators.js`

### 4. NoSQL Injection Protection
**Purpose:** Prevent MongoDB injection attacks

**Implementation:**
- **express-mongo-sanitize:** Strips `$` and `.` from user input
- **Mongoose:** Built-in casting and validation
- **Input validation:** All inputs validated before database operations

### 5. Session Security
**Purpose:** Secure user authentication

**Features:**
- **httpOnly cookies:** Prevents JavaScript access to session cookies
- **sameSite: 'strict':** CSRF protection
- **secure flag:** HTTPS-only in production
- **MongoDB session store:** Persistent, secure session storage
- **7-day expiration:** Automatic session cleanup

### 6. Password Security
**Purpose:** Protect user passwords

**Features:**
- **bcryptjs hashing:** Industry-standard password hashing
- **Salt rounds: 10:** Secure hash generation
- **Password requirements:** Minimum 8 chars, complexity rules
- **No password in responses:** Passwords excluded from API responses

### 7. CORS Configuration
**Purpose:** Control cross-origin requests

**Implementation:**
- Configurable allowed origins
- Credentials support for authenticated requests
- Environment-specific settings

### 8. Error Handling
**Purpose:** Prevent information leakage

**Features:**
- **Centralized error handler:** Consistent error responses
- **Development vs Production:** Stack traces only in development
- **Specific error types:** Validation, cast, duplicate key errors
- **Logging:** All errors logged to files

### 9. Request Logging
**Purpose:** Security monitoring and audit trail

**Logs Created:**
- **access.log:** All HTTP requests with response times
- **auth.log:** Authentication events (login, register, logout)
- **error.log:** All application errors
- **app.log:** Combined application logs
- **debug.log:** Development debugging (dev mode only)

**Information Logged (privacy-minded):**
- Timestamp, request method, path (no query string)
- Status code and response time
- Pseudonymized IP and user agent hashes (not raw values)
- Redacted sensitive fields in metadata (e.g., passwords/tokens/cookies)

**Log file growth control:**
- Basic size-based rotation is applied before appends.
- Configure via environment variables:
   - `LOG_MAX_BYTES` (default: 10485760 / 10MB)
   - `PII_HASH_SALT` (recommended; used to salt pseudonymized hashes for IP/user-agent)
     - Backward compatibility: `LOG_IP_SALT` is also accepted as a fallback.

### 10. Data Sanitization
**Purpose:** Prevent XSS attacks

**Methods:**
- HTML escaping in validators
- Server-side sanitization of user inputs
- Frontend escapeHtml function (see `forum-enhancements.js`)

### 11. Invite-Only Personal Portfolios (Token Gating)
**Purpose:** Prevent public browsing of personal portfolios while still allowing controlled sharing.

**Behavior:**
- Personal portfolio pages (`/portfolio/:username`) require either:
   - an authenticated owner session, or
   - a valid invite token via query string (`?token=...`).
- If the token is missing/invalid/expired/revoked, the API returns a generic 404 (`Portfolio not found`) to avoid leaking whether a username exists.

**Token handling:**
- Raw invite tokens are generated server-side and only returned once at creation time.
- Only a hash (SHA-256) and last-4 are stored server-side.
- Invites can be revoked and can expire.

**Operational guidance:**
- Do not log raw invite tokens (treat them like credentials).
- Prefer short expirations for high-sensitivity portfolios.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Generate strong session secret
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   
   # Set in .env file
   SESSION_SECRET=<generated-secret>
   NODE_ENV=production
   BASE_URL=https://community.example.com
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://community.example.com
   ```

2. **HTTPS Configuration:**
   - Set up SSL/TLS certificates
   - Ensure cookies are marked secure (recommended):
     - Set `BASE_URL` to an `https://...` URL, and/or
     - Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` explicitly
   - Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)

3. **Database Security:**
   - Enable MongoDB authentication
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict database network access
   - Regular backups

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up log rotation (basic size-based rotation is built-in; consider external rotation for long-term retention)
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Alert on unusual activity patterns
   - Regular security audits

5. **Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Regularly update and audit
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   npm update
   ```

6. **Additional Recommendations:**
   - Implement 2FA for admin accounts
   - Regular password rotation policies
   - IP whitelisting for admin routes
   - Database query timeout limits
   - Regular penetration testing

## 📎 Notes on Upload Deletion

The `/api/upload/delete` endpoint is intentionally restrictive:
- Only deletes under `/uploads/avatars/` and `/uploads/posts/`.
- Requires either:
   - The file was uploaded recently in the same session (short TTL), or
   - The caller has `uploads:delete:any`.

This reduces risk of arbitrary file deletion and path traversal issues.

   # Check recent auth events
   grep "Authentication" logs/auth.log | tail -50
   
   # Check error patterns
   grep "ERROR" logs/error.log | tail -50
   
   # Check high-frequency IPs
   grep "HTTP Request" logs/access.log | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
   ```

3. **Response:**
   - Reset affected user passwords
   - Invalidate compromised sessions
